# Diode

A diode is a semiconductor device, typically made of silicon, that essentially acts as a one-way switch for current. It allows current to flow easily in one direction but severely restricts current from flowing in the opposite direction.

Diodes have polarity, determined by an anode (positive lead) and cathode (negative lead). Most diodes allow current to flow only when positive voltage is applied to the anode.

When a diode allows current flow, it is forward-biased. When a diode is reverse-biased, it acts as an insulator and does not permit current to flow.

## Applications of Diodes

- **Power Conversion:** Rectifiers convert AC signal into pulsing DC signal, making it easier to control the flow of power.
- **Signal Demodulation:** Demodulation diodes are a critical part of radio receivers. The diodes retrieve the original message sent through the airwaves for transmission.
- **Overvoltage Protection:** Zener diodes are used to protect circuits from unsafe voltage levels. They are also used to protect supply lines and power supply control lines.
- **Logic Gates:** Diodes play a crucial role in modern computing and digital technology. They make it possible to reinforce binary systems through gates that perform simple logic functions, like and/or/not.
