### Details

#### Passive Components
A passive component, also known as a passive device, is an electronic component which can only receive energy, which it can either dissipate, absorb, or store in an electric field or a magnetic field. Passive components do not need any form of independent electrical power to operate. Passive devices are incapable of controlling current by means of another electrical signal. There are several types of passive components, including resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers.

#### Active Components
Active components in electronics are parts that require a power source to operate and can control the flow of electricity, often able to amplify signals or switch current on and off.
